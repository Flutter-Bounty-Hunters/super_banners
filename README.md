# Super Banners
Displays angled banners in a corner of your choice.

Banners are useful for product-wide messages, such as announcing that your product
is in the "alpha" or "beta" stage.

You can also announce to the world that your product was build with Flutter by using
the `BuildWithFlutterBanner` widget.
